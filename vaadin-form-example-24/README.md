# Project example for creating a signup form with Vaadin Flow

This project demonstrates how to create a more complex form using Vaadin 
Flow's Java API (Binder). The form code can be found in MainView.java. In 
addition, AvatarField.java has an implementation of a custom field.

The idea behind this example is to demonstrate various features of the Vaadin Binder, including data binding, automatic validation, error handling, and custom data type handling.
